# PlacentaBarrier

Just trying to infer few more drugs based on the dataset obtained from Fillipo etal and using the logic of Chandrasekar et al for inference.

# New functions and Visulizations added
Created few Functions for checking the inference and confidence of the model and PCA plots to check where the drug inferred stands in the population of trained data and test data.

Plot function helps analyzing the PCA distance and confidence as metrics to look for better model and reliability (trustworthiness)

Please cite the bellow paper if the code is used in anyway.
